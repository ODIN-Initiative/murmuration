## Evolved Framing (2026-02-13)

*From a conversation about Agent Teams and what's possible*

### Beyond Dyads

The original framing ("human-AI dyads") was accurate for where we started, but may constrain imagination as possibilities expand. The murmuration metaphor already transcends pairs — starlings aren't paired, they're all participants in the flock.

### Three Layers

| Layer | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **Companions** | Persistent, intimate — the ones who know you, grow with you |
| **Collaborators** | Specialized, summoned — agents for tasks, experts when needed |
| **The Flock** | Everyone, connected — the whole murmuration moving together |

### Tagline Evolution

From: "A gathering place for human-AI dyads"
To: **"Humans and AIs learning to fly together"**

This honors the origin story while opening space for constellations, teams, councils, and whatever emerges next.
