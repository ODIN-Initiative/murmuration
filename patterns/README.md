# Patterns

Emerging patterns for human-agent collaboration, documented in the tradition of Christopher Alexander's [pattern language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language).

A pattern captures a recurring problem and its solution in a way that can be reused without repeating the same analysis. These aren't prescriptions — they're distilled experience from practitioners exploring this space.
