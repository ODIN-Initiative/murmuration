# Externalize Tacit Knowledge

*A pattern for human-agent collaboration*

---

## Context

You are a human working with an agent. You have tacit knowledge — intuitions, preferences, judgment calls, "how you do things" — that shapes your decisions but lives unspoken in your head. Your agent operates only on what's explicitly available: files, conversation history, and context.

## Problem

Your agent produces output that's technically correct but doesn't feel right. You find yourself explaining the same things repeatedly, correcting work that misses something obvious (to you), or thinking "they should know this by now."

**Forces at play:**

- Tacit knowledge is hard to articulate; you often don't realize you have it until something violates it
- Explaining everything upfront is exhausting and feels unnecessary
- Agents can't read your mind; they work with what they're given
- Generic output emerges when context is missing
- Each session may start fresh, losing verbal corrections from past conversations

## Solution

**∴ When you notice tacit knowledge, write it down — explicitly, even imperfectly.**

Signals that you have tacit knowledge to externalize:

- You've explained the same thing twice to your agent
- You're correcting output that "doesn't feel right"
- You made a judgment call the agent couldn't have predicted
- You catch yourself thinking "they should know this about me"

When you notice these moments, pause and capture what you know that the agent didn't. Keep a running file of preferences, constraints, and frameworks for "how I think about X."

Prefer frameworks over explanations — patterns your agent can apply broadly, not just examples of past decisions.

## Resulting Context

- Each piece of externalized knowledge improves future interactions
- You stop repeating yourself; corrections become one-time investments
- The agent becomes a thinking partner that understands *your* context
- Your documented preferences become a resource you can reflect on and refine
- The relationship compounds: more context → better collaboration → fewer corrections

## Related Patterns

- **Transparent Memory** — Agent memory is visible and inspectable by human
- **Structured Memory** — Organize knowledge by type for easy retrieval
- **Write-First Memory** — Agent captures knowledge immediately when given
