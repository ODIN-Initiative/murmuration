# Protocols

Operational protocols for human-agent collaboration — structured procedures that can be loaded or referenced during work.

Unlike [patterns](../patterns/), which describe recurring problems and their solutions in Alexander's pattern language style, protocols are executable frameworks: step-by-step procedures, checklists, or agent directives designed to be applied directly.
